Individual Information Aggregation Assignment

- [ ] All information should be shown in a single aggregate news list
- [ ] The user should be able to decide to show only certain news feeds. This should be done in real time.
- [ ] The user should be able to 'favorite' stories. They should be able to see a list of their favorite stories and remove them from the list.
- [ ] The single page application should be aesthetically pleasing, clean and easy to use.
- [ ] Data storage should be done in a local XML/JSon file. Relational SQL and MongoDB are not allowed. You also may not use .csv, or flatfiles.
- [ ] You must ensure that your application has proper responsive design. I will be using several recent browsers and mobile devices to test your site.
- [ ] User's should be able to create new accounts. This means that someone should be able to visit the page, and select that they want to create a new user. They should create a new username and password. Security is not an issue here, so don't worry about storing user names/passwords in XML/JSON. You do not need any forgot password reminders.
- [ ] Use cookies to remember the last time a user visited the page. This information should be shown on the main page ("Your last visit was on mm-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss")
- [ ] Optimally, the site should use AJAX to eliminate the need for refreshing the page. All information should be shown in real time.
- [ ] The news list should never end. If you keep scrolling down, older items should automatically appear.
- [ ] The most current items should be shown at the top of the page. As you scroll down the page, the items should get older (think how Twitter shows tweets.)
